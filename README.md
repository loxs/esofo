=====

Easy simple_one_for_one - boilerplate for when you need to manage many simple
processes, but don't want to have to implement the same babysitting code every
time. By using esofo you don't have to implement any of these:

* simple_one_for_one supervisor
* hibernate your process after a specified period of inactivity
* terminate your process after a specified period of inactivity
